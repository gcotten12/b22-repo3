to remote github repository
Few things happened:
1. it automatically created new Remote Repo
	under your github.com account
2. Made the connection with your local repo
3. Added all your commits to remote repo

Now our work will continue locally

2. commited the changes to local repo
3. We want this change to be reflected in 
remote repo so We Pushed local commits to
remote repositiory using push origin button
